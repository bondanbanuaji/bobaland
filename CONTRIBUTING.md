- Keep scripts modular and idempotent.
- Add comments explaining complex logic.

### Configurations
- Keep `.config/` files organized.
- Use variables for colors and common settings.
- Ensure window rules are specific enough not to break other apps.

### Documentation
- Updates to features must be reflected in `README.md`.
- New keybindings must be added to `KEYBINDINGS.md`.
- Complex settings should be explained in `CONFIGURATION.md`.
